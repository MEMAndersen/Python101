    "# Exercise \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "This exercise is taken from a project example where shear forces in a shell element from a Sofistik Finite Element calcuatation are extracted and plotted into one figure per Construction Stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this procedure to give a quick overview of the results after a calculation has finished, and to be able to flip through the Construction Stages to easily compare them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are in total 56 Construction Stages in the dataset used and three different shear keys, resulting in 168 plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each plot will look something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](BS301_LC4069.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some plots will be almost empty as loads are close to zero in some Stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `shear_keys_base_slab_v20.txt` and can be found in the Session 6 folder for the workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Understanding the structural context of the dataset is not important for solving the exercise. The same concepts could be used for all other types of datasets. \n",
