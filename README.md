## Python 101 - Python for Beginners

This GitHub repository contains material for a beginner Python course held in COWI Lyngby during Fall 2019.

## Sessions Notes and Exercises
Descriptions and exercises for each session are in the format of HTML-files created with Jupyter Notebooks. See links to the files for each session below.

In the *code* tab of this repository there will be a folder for each session. In case an exercise requires additional files like .csv-files or scripts, they will be present there.

## Course Notes
Some notes have been prepared for the course, but is still work in progress:
[Course Notes (work in progress)](https://github.com/Python-Crash-Course/Python101/blob/master/Course%20Notes/Python%20Course%20Notes.html)

These notes have some content that overlaps with the notes for each session, but is in general a more overall explanation. It also contains more detailed descipriptions of some topics that did not fit into the session notes.
