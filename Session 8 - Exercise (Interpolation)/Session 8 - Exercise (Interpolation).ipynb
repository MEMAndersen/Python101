    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is mostly about reading and understanding code written by others. Which is often just as important as being able to write it oneself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1.1\n",
    "Read through the code given in the scipt below and try to understand what it does and how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the script tot he editor and run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add print statements if you are unsure about how a certain varaible looks at any point. Remember you can print the first five rows of a dataframe with `df.head()`.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The script reads two Excel files. One limitation of this is that they cannot be read while they are open. If you want to inspect these files while running the script, create a copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1.2\n",
    "The variable `settlements_interpolated` is a numpy array (you can see this by `type(settlements_interpolated)` => `<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of the code creates a figure object and an axis object which enables 3D plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1.3\n",
    "All the settlement values in the base slab are in this example to be transferred to and applied in a Sofistik calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we can create a text file with the exact syntax that the Sofistik input language accepts (this language is called CADINP and is somewhat similar to IBDAS's input language). The file has to be a `.dat`-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write data to a file we can use something called **context managers**. Basically, it allows us to open a file and write to it. See code snippet below:\n",
